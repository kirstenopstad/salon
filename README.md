## Objectives (MVP)

### Prompt
You've been referred to the owner of a hair salon called BRUSH Salon. She has contracted you out to create an MVC web application to help her manage her employees (stylists) and their clients. The owner should be able to add a list of stylists working at the salon, and for each stylist, add clients who see that stylist. The stylists have specific specialties, so each client can only see (belong to) a single stylist.

### User Stories
  * ✅ As the salon owner, I need to be able to see a list of all stylists. 
  * ✅ As the salon owner, I need to be able to select a stylist, see their details, and see a list of all clients that belong to that stylist. 
  * ✅ As the salon owner, I need to add new stylists to our system when they are hired. 
  * ✅ As the salon owner, I need to be able to add new clients to a specific stylist. I should not be able to add a client if no stylists have been added. 

### Outline
1. Stylists 
  - ✅ Index [READ] 
  - ✅ Details [READ] 
  - ✅ Create [CREATE] 
  - ✅ Edit [UPDATE]
  - ✅ Delete [DELETE]

2. Clients 
  - ✅ Index [READ] 
  - ✅ Details [READ] 
  - ✅ Create [CREATE]
  - ✅ Edit [UPDATE]
  - ✅ Delete [DELETE]

<!-- #### Naming
Note: You must follow the naming conventions for your project. Projects that do not follow these conventions will not be reviewed and will be returned not passing.

Use your first name and last name to name your database in the following way:

Production Database: first_last
Use the following name for your directory:

Main Project Folder: HairSalon

#### Exported Database
When you're finished, export the .sql file holding the information from your production database.

Please commit this file with your project in the top level of your solution folder. Again, use your first and last name as the file name following the pattern below:

Production Database: first_last.sql
If you name your database, project folder, or .sql file incorrectly your project will be sent back to you immediately without being graded. -->

### Additional Objectives
Your code will be reviewed for the following objectives:

* Do the database table and column names follow proper naming conventions?
* Do the project folder and exported database follow the specific naming requirements for this project?
* Is there a one-to-many relationship set up correctly in the database?
* Is CREATE functionality included for one class and is CREATE and VIEW functionality included for the other class?
* Is EF Core used for communication with the database?
* Build files and sensitive information are included in .gitignore file and is not to be tracked by Git, and includes instructions on how to create the appsettings.json and set up the project.
* Project is in a polished, portfolio-quality state.
The prompt’s required functionality and baseline project requirements are in place by the deadline.
